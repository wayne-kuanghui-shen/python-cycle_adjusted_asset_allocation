# *Navigating the Economic Cycle for Optimal Asset Allocation*

**‚úèÔ∏è Introduction**: Mastering the economic cycle can significantly enhance one's investment performance. By identifying the patterns of asset returns in different stages of the economic cycle, we can tactically adjust the asset class and sector allocations based on macroeconomic dynamics, potentially generating excess returns.

## ‚õ≥Ô∏è Objectives 
- Divide the economic cycle into four stages based on growth and inflation
- Investigate the best-performaning stage of the economic cycle for each asset class
- Explore the best-performaning asset classes in each stage of the economic cycle
- Develop an asset allocation strategy that benefits from the shift in economic activities

## üìç Conclusions
- Across economic cycles, certain asset classes significantly outperformed the others over time 
- However, different assets behaved differently within economic cycles. In general:
  - (1)Equities performed the best in the Early Cycle;
  - (2)Fixed income had the highest return in the Recession stage;
  - (3)Commodities were the type of assets you want to own in the Mid Cycle
- A portfolio that dynamically adjusts the allocation based on economic cycles outperformed an equal-weight portfolio by 3.1% in terms of average annualized returns
